should be able to to use the frames from the tello stream in main/jess opencv one and run them in as images through the model, probably best to do this before the
trasnformations on the frame (like the edge thing), then have a few decisions based on this output.

Also the stuff is in functions because i lifted them off of my NEA, so can be removed completely and just executed in the order that the functions are in.

For the model training I used like ~700 images per class in total but this was a group of like >100 <200 images rotated different different directions
so may end up needing quite a few images in different lighting and backgrounds (or could be the way i layered my model was bad lmao)

use the updated one it should be a bit better than the other one
